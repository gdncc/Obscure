# Raku Cryptography Playground

Implemented: 

- [`Obscure::Hashes::SHA3`](doc/Hashes/SHA3.md): A pure Raku implementation of
the SHAâ€‘3 and SHAKE hash families. It provides four cryptographic hash
functions, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512, and two extendable-output
functions (XOFs), SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 of the SHA-3 family of functions. It
provides one-shot, and streaming APIs.
